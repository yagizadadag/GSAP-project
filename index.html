            Amanda is a Brazilian fashion designer based in Miami. From an early age she was interested in the arts and
            manual tasks and her favorite activity was always drawing, which she loves to do until the present days. For
            Amanda, few things are more pleasurable than seeing an idea become material and enter people's lives,
            creating bonds between those who create and those who wear it.

            It's her way of being in the world. She is fascinated by the beauty of colors and its combinations, the
            mixture of geometric and organic shapes, different materials with its textures and finishes.

            <a href="#" class="paragraph-link">She has always been curious and loves to see and explore the world</a>, learn other languages and cultures.
            Traveling is one of the things she enjoys the most, not only to relax, but also to learn and research. When
            younger, she moved to Germany to study design at  <a href="#" class="paragraph-link">Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main</a> and then to
            Portugal to specialize in Fashion Design at Universidade do Minho, an opportunity that helped her to improve
            her knowledge on developing a fashion collection and creating a new product.

            Back to Brazil, she founded <a href="#" class="paragraph-link">Trocando em Miúdos</a>, a brand that has become a reference in accessories design
            and creative economy in Brazil. The brand gathered fans for more than a decade and its works were featured
            in several international medias and magazines such as <a href="#" class="paragraph-link">Vogue Brasil, Marie Claire</a>, among others.

            Since 2018 Amanda has been living in Miami, USA, a new experience that is helping her to expand her cultural
            horizons. Her values for a design process are shaped by building products with beauty, quality, meaning and
            purpose.
